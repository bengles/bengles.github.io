### About

My name is Björn Englesson and I graduated from [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/) in 2017 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a master's degree in Human Computer Interaction. For the past few years I've been working on [THE FINALS](https://www.reachthefinals.com/) for [Embark Studios](https://www.embark-studios.com/) as a Gameplay Engineer.
