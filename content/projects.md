I spent some time learning about multiplay networking and decided to take a stab at making a very simple networking library for the bevy engine, which I called bevy benet.

### Colorful Mario

I spent an evening to see if I could use [the decompiled version of Super Mario 64](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64) to change Mario's outfit's color. [You can watch it here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eces7lJPWts)

### Mouse Eater

A small game I made with some friends from work during one of Embark Studios' weekend gamejams that I arranged. In Mouse Eater you guide a mouse with cheese to get it away from the monster which will eat the mouse. [You can play it here!](https://bengles.itch.io/mouse-eater)

### World of Warcraft Arena Clone

To get more familiar with Unreal Engine's gameplay ability system I decided to try to recreate a small subset of World of Warcraft's PvP arena gameplay. It was very simple but gave me quite the insights into Unreal Engine's gameplay ability system.

### Tactonics

A small game I made with some friends from work during one of Embark Studios' weekend gamejams that I arranged. In Tactonics you use a grapple hook to pull floating islands into your island to make it as big as possible.

### Card Reload

My submission for the Mix and Game Jam 2020 with a few friends from Resolution Games. In it you try to avoid being killed by monsters for as long as possible by shooting incoming monsters, but to reload your gun you need to input whatever the reload cards tell you.

### the floor will be lava

My submission for the GMTK Game Jam 2020. In the game you need to place strategic bombs to block an incoming lava wave that will otherwise submerge the your lovely heart. [Play it here!](https://bengles.itch.io/the-floor-will-be-lava)

### Vine Knot

A few friends and I traveled to Warsaw, Poland and attended the Slavic Game Jam 2019 and created Vine Knot which is a PvP local multiplayer game where you as the player shoot seeds that grow into vines as the land. You need to take out the other players before they take out you, but watch out for the fire pit in the center which will set fire to the vines if they get too close.
