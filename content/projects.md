### World of Warcraft Arena Clone - 2021

To get more familiar with Unreal Engine's gameplay ability system I decided to try to recreate a small subset of World of Warcraft's PvP arena gameplay. It was very simple but gave me quite the insights into Unreal Engine's gameplay ability system.

### Card Reload - 2020

My submission for the Mix and Game Jam 2020 with a few friends from Resolution Games. In it, you try to avoid being killed by monsters for as long as possible by shooting incoming monsters, but to reload your gun you need to input whatever the reload cards tell you. [You can play it here!](https://bengles.itch.io/card-reload)

### Vine Knot - 2019

A few friends and I traveled to Warsaw, Poland, and attended the Slavic Game Jam 2019 and created Vine Knot which is a PvP local multiplayer game where you as the player shoot seeds that grow into vines as the land. You need to take out the other players before they take out you, but watch out for the fire pit in the center which will set fire to the vines if they get too close. [You can download and play it here!](https://eitrum.itch.io/vine-knot)
