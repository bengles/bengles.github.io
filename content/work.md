### Embark Studios - Aug 2020 - Present

At Embark Studios I've worked on [THE FINALS](https://www.reachthefinals.com/) since the very early days of the project, and have had the pleasure to bring it from its infancy to a fully fledged released game, together with some of the industry's best game developers. [THE FINALS](https://www.reachthefinals.com/) released in December 2023 and is now a live service game.

### Resolution Games - Aug 2018 - July 2020

At [Resolution Games](https://www.resolutiongames.com/) I worked on the game [Angry Birds VR: Isle of Pigs](https://www.resolutiongames.com/angry-birds-vr-isle-of-pigs) which is a virtual reality take on the classic mobile game [Angry Birds](https://www.angrybirds.com/play/). This included developing and shipping the game on multiple platforms including Oculus Quest, Steam, and Playstation VR. Furthermore, we created a [level editor](https://www.uploadvr.com/angry-birds-vr-online-level-sharing/) for our users to create and share their own levels.

### KTH - Aug 2017 - Dec 2017

After graduation I worked at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/) as a research engineer. I developed an app for the research project Mixed Reality Stockholm that focused on using augmented reality to navigate in Stockholm. I also developed the KTH Campus 100 app which was an augmented reality guided quiz through KTH Campus Valhallav√§gen which celebrated a 100 years.
